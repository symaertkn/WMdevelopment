# Number Game

We tried a few student selection options.

## Selection 1

Select students: - record in quarters in which they played more than 4
sessions - select the *correct answers* - that have at least 8 quarters
for 4 years (half of it)

``` r
correct_set_size_development <- logs_quarter %>% 
  group_by(user_id, quarter) %>% #calculate max and mean set size for the quarters for students
  summarise(mean_set_size = mean(set_size, na.rm = TRUE), 
            median_set_size = median(set_size, na.rm = TRUE),
            max_set_size = max(set_size, na.rm = TRUE),
            min_set_size = min(set_size, na.rm = TRUE),
            plays = n()) %>%
  ungroup()  
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'user_id'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
length(unique(correct_set_size_development$user_id))
```

    ## [1] 5

``` r
