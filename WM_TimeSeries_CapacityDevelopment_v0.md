# Number Game

We tried a few student selection options.

## Selection 1

Select students: - record in quarters in which they played more than 4
sessions - select the *correct answers* - that have at least 8 quarters
for 4 years (half of it)

``` r
correct_set_size_development <- logs_quarter %>% 
  group_by(user_id, quarter) %>% #calculate max and mean set size for the quarters for students
  summarise(mean_set_size = mean(set_size, na.rm = TRUE), 
            median_set_size = median(set_size, na.rm = TRUE),
            max_set_size = max(set_size, na.rm = TRUE),
            min_set_size = min(set_size, na.rm = TRUE),
            plays = n()) %>%
  ungroup()  
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'user_id'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
length(unique(correct_set_size_development$user_id))
```

    ## [1] 5

record in quarters in which they played more than 4 sessions - select
the *correct answers* - that have at least 8 quarters for 4 years (half

\## Best Students

We select the students that improved the most with the condition of:

students with - in quarters in which played more than 4 sessions  
- select the *correct answers* - that have at least 8 quarters for 4
years (half of it)

``` r

    improvement = final_set_size - initial_set_size

  arrange(desc(improvement))

# Select top 10 students with the most improvement
top_students40 <- student_improvement40 %>%
  top_n(10, improvement) %>%

## Selection - Most students

*Do we try to select students that played at least two different days to
select so that we know for sure that the decrease is not result of a bad
day?*

``` r
students_month6_450daysMole <- filter_users_by_plays_and_months(data=merged_logs_mole, min_plays = 20 , min_months = 6, min_duration = 450)
nrow(students_month6_450daysMole)
```

    ## [1] 3121

We have 3121 students that played the Number game at least 6 months with
2 sessions for min duration of 450 days.Letâ€™s look at the grade levels.

``` r
merged_logs_mole_tmp <- merged_logs_mole %>% 
  filter(user_id %in% students_month6_450daysMole$user_id) %>% 
  group_by(user_id, year_month) %>%
  filter(n() >= 20) %>% # Ensure at least 20 plays in each month we utilize
  ungroup()

    ## [1] 2135

We have 2135 students from grade 4. But some of the data may be coming
from grade 3 so filter for at least 6 months and select random 10
students.

``` r
